# CYSHOP
CY SHOP is a project for managing a store's stock and its customers, in this case the UTOPIA store.
It's a program for managing stocks: adding stocks of a product when there are none left, information on remaining places in the shop etc... and managing customers who want to buy products: search bar, product menu, shopping basket etc... to help customers with their purchases. 
This program also comes with a login function to access the different modes and create an UTOPIA shop account.
